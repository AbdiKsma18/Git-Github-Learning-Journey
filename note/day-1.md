# January, 27 2026.
## This is First day on Learning Git & Github.
I'm Practicing in making my own repository, and pushing file to Github.
On this day, I learn a few Git Commands, such as:


# Working Locally
- `cd (directory)` <br>
This command changes the working directory

- `mkdir (name)` <br>
With this command, we can create a folder within the repository

- `touch (filename)` <br>
With this command, we can create a file within the repository

- `git innit` <br>
Initialize Git in a folder

- `git status` <br>
Check repository status

- `code .` <br>
Run code or text editor 

- `git add filename.txt` <br>
Add a file to staging area

- `git add .` <br>
Add all files

- `git commit -m "Your commit message"` <br>
Commit changes (save point)

# Working Remotely (GitHub Sync)
- `git push -u origin main` <br>
Push to GitHub (first time)

- `git push` <br>
Push to Github

- `git pull` <br>
Pull latest changes

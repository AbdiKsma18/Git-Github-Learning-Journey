# January, 27 2026.
## This is First day on Learning Git & Github.
I'm Practicing in making my own repository, and pushing file to Github.
On this day, I learn a few Git Commands, such as:


# Working Locally
- 'cd (directory)'
This command changes the working directory

- 'mkdir (name)'
With this command, we can create a folder within the repository

- 'touch' (filename)'
With this command, we can create a file within the repository

- 'git innit'
Initialize Git in a folder

- 'git status'
Check repository status

- 'code .'
Run code or text editor 

- 'git add filename.txt'
Add a file to staging area

- 'git add .'
Add all files

- 'git commit -m "Your commit message"'
Commit changes (save point)

# Working Remotely (GitHub Sync)
- 'git push -u origin main'
Push to GitHub (first time)

- 'git push'
Push to Github

- 'git pull'
Pull latest changes
